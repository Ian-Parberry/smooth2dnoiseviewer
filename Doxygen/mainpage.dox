/// The source code for this basic 2D noise generator, written and maintained by
/// [Ian Parberry](http://ianparberry.com), is intended to be used by students to
/// extend and modify while they are learning about Perlin noise. It can
/// generate and save images from a few hard-coded algorithms for 2D noise.
